# Original Software Task

This repository contains two projects: 

`RailwayService` and `HowLongDoesItTakesToGetTo`

The `Railway Service` project is an ASP.net core API that calculates the time it takes a person to go from one station to another.
The `HowLongDoesItTakesToGetTo` project is an SPA built with Angular that connects to the API for using the specified functionality.

Each project should be running before in order to use the application.

Please read the Readme inside each project to understand the thought process behind some decisions as well as using them as documentation.
